Loan Approval Prediction

📌 Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to automate loan approval decisions. Traditional manual reviews are often slow, inconsistent, and biased. By leveraging data analytics and ML, this system predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected, ensuring faster, fairer, and more accurate outcomes.

🎯 Problem
Loan approval depends on multiple factors:
Demographics: Age, education, employment
Credit factors: Credit score, past debts
Financials: Income, loan amount, loan term
Socio-economic: Housing, lifestyle stability

The goal is to create a data-driven, unbiased, and scalable model to replace subjective manual decisions.
